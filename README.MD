# LOLESPORTS API (by xmadking)

## Introduction
This is just a an easier to install and use (for python) version of https://vickz84259.github.io/lolesports-api-docs/ This api will also do a little more stuff but its very similar. So, special thanks to vickz84259 as this would not be possible if not for the documentation. 

## Guide
(will add when the project is fully finished)
