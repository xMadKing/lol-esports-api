# LOLESPORTS API (by xmadking)

## Introduction
This is just a an easier to install and use (for python) version of https://vickz84259.github.io/lolesports-api-docs/ This api will also do a little more stuff but its very similar. So, special thanks to vickz84259 as this would not be possible if not for the documentation. 

## How to install

I plan to eventually package this and upload it to PyPI, however, you can use this right now by installing the code and manually adding the library to your project. 

There are 4 main 'API's in the project
1. Leagues API (Information in regards to leagues, such as LPL, LCK, LEC, LCS and more)
2. Match API (Information in regards to matches, details, results, etc... )
3. Teams API (Information about the teams, players, logos, etc...)
4. Events API (Information about events, live, games, schedule, etc... )

You can either import each API individually or import them all using the lol-api.py file.
